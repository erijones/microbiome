+ Dynamics of antibiotic + bacteria dynamics in Yurtsev et al, 2013
+ Thesis: when quantifying bacterial antibiotic resistance, it is better to
  measure a single bacterium's response to antibiotics (smMIC) rather than a
  collective bacteria colony's response to antibiotics (MIC), since the latter
  doesn't take into account cooperative growth
